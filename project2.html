                The Music Management System is a comprehensive Python-based application aimed at facilitating the management and streaming of music. It caters to two primary user types: regular users and artists. Regular users can log in to browse, view, and download available songs. <br> Artists, on the other hand, can log in to upload new songs to the system, specifying details such as the song name, genre, and language. <br>
                The application utilizes a PostgreSQL database to securely store user credentials, song details, and download records, ensuring robust data management. <br> The graphical user interface (GUI) is developed using Tkinter, providing an intuitive and user-friendly experience. <br> Upon successful login, users are directed to a window displaying the song list, while artists are taken to an upload window where they can manage their music contributions.
